# Testing Helpers for signalstory

This module provides testing utilities to streamline the testing process for the SignalStory library. The testing helpers are exposed under the secondary entrypoint `signalstory/testing`, following the conventions of `ng-packagr` and `Angular`. Note, that the test files for signalstory itself are under: `packages/signalstory/src/__tests__`.
